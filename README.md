**Library Management Application**

The Library Management Application is a Java-based project that facilitates efficient management of a library's resources. 
This application showcases various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, Java features, 
and best practices in software development.

**Features:**
- **Publication Management:** Easily add and remove publications, including books and magazines, using a user-friendly interface.
- **Publication Display:** View the list of publications in the library with details such as title, author, and publication type.
- **Publication Search:** Utilize the search functionality to quickly find specific books within the library.
- **User Management:** Manage library users, enabling you to add and view user information.
- **Serialization:** Serialize publication and user data to store and retrieve information efficiently.
- **CSV Export:** Export publication data to CSV files for further analysis or backup purposes.
- **Advanced OOP Concepts:** The project demonstrates the use of classes, access specifiers, control statements, enums, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces, and inner classes.
- **Collections Framework:** Utilize Java's Collections Framework for efficient data storage and manipulation.
- **Exception Handling:** Implement exception handling to ensure the application's robustness and graceful error recovery.
- **User Input Handling:** Interact with users using the Scanner class for input processing.
- **Code Reusability:** Benefit from modular code design to promote reusability and maintainability.

**Getting Started**
**1.Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/your-username/library-app.git.
**2.Compile and Run:** Navigate to the project directory and compile the Java files using javac. Run the application using java Main.
**3. Interact:** Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the application's functionalities.

**Usage**
**- Adding a Publication:** Choose the publication type (book/magazine) and provide the required details such as title, author, and publication date.
